## Documentation for DigitalSaucepan Apps

# **Under Construction**

### About this documentation
The main purpose of this site is to demonstrate how to use various features of these Apps.  

Additionally, a brief description of the technology used to create these Apps is given in collapsed sections like so:  
<details><summary>Tech: Blurbs</summary><p><blockquote>
These technology blurbs are created using <code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;</code> HTML tags, and should render on all modern browsers (except Microsoft Edge, but I believe that will be fixed in an upcoming update).
</blockquote></p></details>

Just ignore these Tech Notes if you're not interested in details about how these apps were made.
